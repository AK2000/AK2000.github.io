Hello! I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago working with Professors Kyle Chard and Ian Foster in the Globuse Labs group. I am currently interested in designing computer systems to improve the efficiency and more broadly the environmental systainability of scientific applications. As I am continuously learning during this Ph.D. process, I am also dabling in compilers and sparse linear algebra, with the hope that I can unite these interests at some point in the future.

Prior to joining the University of Chicago, I was a student at the University of Illinois in Ubrana-Champaign (UIUC), and a research intern a Pacific Northwest National Labs (PNNL).
